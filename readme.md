## Task 1 - DESIGN TWO CLASSES
Design two classes to represent the dictionary:
* BinarySearchTree - internally uses BST,
* AVLTree – internally uses AVL tree.

For each dictionary class implement at least:
* insertion,
* removal (BST only),
* searching (by key),
* display,
* destructor.

Key in the dictionary should be unique.
The class interface must match that in the provided code.
The classes must pass the provided tests. You can add your own private and public methods, and additional unit tests.

## Task 2 – COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
Examine the computational complexity of the search and insert operations for the implemented dictionaries. Prepare a report containing:
* graphs of the search time depending on the dictionary size,
* graphs of the insertion time depending on the dictionary size,
* discuss the obtained results.
